Expense model

category model
has_many expenses

budget model
has_many expenses through categories

problem is category serves as a collection of expenses 
  instead of just a data item
  



category could just be a field in the expense model and is set 
    from a select.  this would allow custom categories and could simply
    be listed after the pre-set categories.  pre-set categories would
    be an application constant array.  display of categories simply looped
    through in the view, then add any left at the end.
